This is the final project submission for CMPT 732 - Big Data Lab 1

The dataset used is Oh Canada! Sample of Canadian FHIR Data: 124 MB. Synthetic Canadian patients spread across provinces, and can be found here - https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads.

The project aims to create a data pipeline that will achieve the following:
1. The input is semi-structured data - JSON file for each patient. The first step is to transform the data and load it into specific tables in parquet format.
2. Clean the data 
3. Data Analysis and visualization 
4. Data transformation for machine learning 
5. Machine Learning
